# Metrology GUM Tool 🧪💻

### Professional Uncertainty Analysis for Chemical Sciences

This repository features an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** tool developed in **Python** to automate the calculation of **Type A Uncertainty**, following the **GUM (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement)** and **ISO 17025** standards.

## 🔬 Scientific Foundation
As a **Master of Chemical Sciences (UNAM)**, I developed this tool to bridge the gap between analytical chemistry and data science. The script processes raw weighing data to determine:
* **Arithmetic Mean**
* **Sample Standard Deviation**
* **Standard Uncertainty (Type A)**

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Architecture:** OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
* **Cloud Ready:** Prepared for **AWS Cloud** deployment.
